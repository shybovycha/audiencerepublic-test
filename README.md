# Test task

## Usage

```bash
$ lein repl
```

and then, in REPL

```clojure
;; note the below function might generate non-acyclic graph, so longest path might not work (as well as eccentrity for such graph)
(def G (make-graph 10 10))
(shortest-path G :1 :10)
(longest-path G :1 :10)
(radius G)
(diameter G)
```
